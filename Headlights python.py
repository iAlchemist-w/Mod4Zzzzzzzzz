#2. The headlights of a car should only automatically turn on when the daylight outside is below a certain threshold. If a sensor threshold is below the number 8, print "Headlights On"; otherwise, print "Headlights Off".

# Write your code here :-)
sensor_threshold = 7
if not (sensor_threshold) >= 8:
    print("Headlights On! It's dark out!")
else:
    print("Headlights off, it is not dark out yet.")
